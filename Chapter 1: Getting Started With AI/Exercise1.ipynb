    "Imagine that you've been assigned the task to plan the route of a container ship loaded with pineapples. The ship starts in Panama, loaded with delicious Fairtrade pineapples. There are four other ports, New York, Casablanca, Amsterdam, and Helsinki, where pineapple-craving citizens are eagerly waiting. The ship must visit each of the four destination ports exactly once, but the order in which each port is visited is free. The goal is to minimize the carbon emissions, which means that a shorter route is better than a longer one.\n",
