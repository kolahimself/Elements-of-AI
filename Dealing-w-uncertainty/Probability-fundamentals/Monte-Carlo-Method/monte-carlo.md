# Monte Carlo Method

This coding exercise demonstrates the so-called Monte Carlo method: simulating random data and estimating probabilities by counting occurrences. While simplistic, it is often remarkably useful. Sometimes it is the best way to avoid spending an eternity doing complex math.

## Flip the Coin
This program demonstrates the monte-carlo method by predicting the occurences of a 5 consecutive Head run in 9,996 tries.
