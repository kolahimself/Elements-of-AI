# Introduction to hill climbing algorithm

A hill-climbing algorithm is a local search algorithm that moves continuously upward (increasing) until the best solution is attained. This algorithm comes to an end when the peak is reached.

This algorithm has a node that comprises two parts: state and value. It begins with a non-optimal state (the hill’s base) and upgrades this state until a certain precondition is met. The heuristic function is used as the basis for this precondition. The process of continuous improvement of the current state of iteration can be termed as climbing. This explains why the algorithm is termed as a hill-climbing algorithm.

A hill-climbing algorithm’s objective is to attain an optimal state that is an upgrade of the existing state. When the current state is improved, the algorithm will perform further incremental changes to the improved state. This process will continue until a peak solution is achieved. The peak state cannot undergo further improvements.
