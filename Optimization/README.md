# An example optimization task

- I have been assigned the task to plan the route of a container ship loaded with pineapples.
- The ship starts in Panama, loaded with delicious Fairtrade pineapples.
- There are four other ports, New York, Casablanca, Amsterdam, and Helsinki, where pineapple-craving citizens are eagerly waiting.
- The ship must visit each of the four destination ports exactly once, but the order in which each port is visited is free.
- The goal is to minimize the carbon emissions, which means that a shorter route is better than a longer one.
